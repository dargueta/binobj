    The method being decorated should take a single argument aside from ``self``, the

    before it's dumped.

    It's highly inadvisable to modify the contents, because it's easy to create invalid
    results. For example, if a struct has a field giving the length of the array and you
    change the length of that array, the length field *won't* update to compensate. You
    must do that yourself.
