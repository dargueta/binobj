class Field(Generic[T]):
    r"""The base class for all struct fields.

    :param str name:
        The name of the field.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.11.0

            Passing a value for this will throw a :class:`ConfigurationError` for
            fields declared in a normal class if it doesn't match the existing name.
            Only use this argument if you're building a struct programmatically.
    :param const:
        A constant value this field is expected to take. It will always have this value
        when dumped, and will fail validation if the field isn't this value when loaded.
        Useful for reserved fields and file tags.

        This argument *must* be of the same type as the field, i.e. it must be a string
        for a :class:`~binobj.fields.stringlike.String`, an integer for an
        :class:`~binobj.fields.numeric.Integer`, and so on.
    :param default:
        The default value to use if a value for this field isn't passed to the struct
        for serialization, (deprecated) or a callable taking no arguments that will
        return a default value.

        This argument *must* be of the same type as the field, i.e. it must be a string
        for a :class:`~binobj.fields.stringlike.String`, an integer for an
        :class:`~binobj.fields.numeric.Integer`, and so on.

        .. deprecated:: 0.11.0
            Do not pass a factory function to this argument. Use ``factory`` instead.
    :param callable factory:
        A callable taking no arguments that returns a default value for this field.
    :param bool discard:
        When deserializing, don't include this field in the returned results. This means
        that you won't be able to use the value for anything later. For example, if you
        need to reference it in a ``present`` function like so::

            name_size = fields.UInt16(discard=True)
            filename = fields.StringZ(encoding="utf-8")
            _filename_padding = fields.Bytes(
                const=b"\0", discard=True, present=lambda f, *_: f["name_size"] % 2
            )

        this will crash with a :class:`KeyError` because ``name_size`` was discarded.
    :param null_value:
        Either a byte string or a value to use to represent ``None`` in serialized data.

        When loading, the returned value will be ``None`` if this exact sequence of
        bytes is encountered. If not given, the field is considered "not nullable" and
        any attempt to assign ``None`` to it will result in a crash upon serialization.
    :param size:
        Optional. The size of the field. This can be a number of things:

        * An integer constant. The field will always be the same size, no matter what
          value is given to it.
        * Another :class:`.Field` object. That field gives the size of this field, in
          bytes.
        * A string naming another field. It's equivalent to passing in a :class:`.Field`
          instance, except used for references in the same class or a field defined in
          the superclass.
    :param validate:
        A callable or list of callables that validates a given value for this field. The
        callable(s) will always be passed the deserialized value, so a validator for an
        :class:`~binobj.fields.numeric.Integer` field will always be passed an integer,
        a :class:`~binobj.fields.stringlike.String` validator will always be passed a
        string, and so on.
    :param callable present:
        Optional. A callable that, when called with the struct as its argument,
        returns a boolean indicating if this field is "present" and should be loaded or
        dumped. For example, if we have a ``flags`` field that's a bitmap indicating
        what fields come next, we could have something like this::

            flags = fields.UInt16()
            foo = fields.StringZ(present=lambda v, *_: v["flags"] & 0x8000)
            bar = fields.StringZ(present=lambda v, *_: v["flags"] & 0x4000)

        Thus, if and only if ``flags`` has bit 15 set, ``foo`` will be read from the
        stream next. If ``flags`` has bit 15 clear, ``foo`` will be assigned the field's
        :attr:`not_present_value` (defaults to :data:`NOT_PRESENT`).

        The callable takes three positional arguments:

        - A dict of the fields that have already been loaded or are about to be dumped.
        - The ``context`` object passed to :meth:`from_stream` or :meth:`to_stream`.
        - When loading, the stream being loaded from. The stream pointer MUST be reset
          to its original position before the function returns.

    :param not_present_value:
        A custom value to return if a field is missing when loading (see the ``present``
        argument). It can be ``None`` or match the datatype of the field, i.e. a string
        for a :class:`~binobj.fields.stringlike.String`, an integer for an
        :class:`~binobj.fields.numeric.Integer`, and so on. If not given, defaults to
        :data:`NOT_PRESENT`.

    .. attribute:: index

        The zero-based index of the field in the struct.

        :type: int

    .. attribute:: offset

        The zero-based byte offset of the field in the struct. If the offset can't be
        computed (e.g. it's preceded by a variable-length field), this will be ``None``.

        :type: int

    .. versionadded:: 0.4.5
        The ``present`` argument.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.8.0
        This now inherits from :class:`typing.Generic`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.9.0

    * The ``not_present_value`` argument.
    * ``size`` has full support for :class:`Field`\s and field name values. This
      used to be only supported by some fields, with others left out by accident.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.9.0
        ``null_value`` can now also be a deserialized value. For example, you could pass
        r"\\N" for a string or 0 for an integer.

    .. deprecated:: 0.9.0
        Passing :data:`DEFAULT` to ``null_value`` for unsized fields such as
        :class:`~binobj.fields.stringlike.StringZ` is deprecated and will trigger an
        error in the future. This resolves the asymmetric behavior where using
        :data:`DEFAULT` throws an error when dumping but happily loads whatever's next
        in the stream when loading.

    .. versionadded:: 0.11.0
        The ``factory`` argument.

    .. deprecated:: 0.11.0
        Passing a factory function to ``default`` is now deprecated. Use ``factory``
        instead.
